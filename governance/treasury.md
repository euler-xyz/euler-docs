# Treasury

## Introduction

All newly created EUL tokens enter circulation initially via a smart contract called the Euler Treasury. The treasury is managed by EUL token holders through on-chain and off-chain governance procedures and overseen by the Euler Foundation.&#x20;

## Address

The address for the treasury is: **0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe**. It can be viewed on Etherscan [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcAD001c30E96765aC90307669d578219D4fb1DCe).

## Multisig

The wallet holding treasury assets is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) MultiSig smart contract wallet. A MultiSig wallet requires multiple private key signatures to authorise transactions. In the case of the Euler Treasury, 4 out 9 signatures are required for every transaction.&#x20;

The identity of the signers of the MultiSig cannot be revealed, for obvious security reasons. However, signers come from a pool of 6 different organisations and, through their contract with the Euler Foundation, are obliged to carry out the wishes of the Euler DAO.&#x20;

The MultiSig, along with its signers, are can be viewed publicly here:
