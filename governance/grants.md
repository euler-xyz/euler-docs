# Grants

## Introduction

To encourage developers to build on top of Euler protocol and help integrate it into the wider DeFi ecosystem, a portion of the Euler [Treasury ](treasury.md)will be allocated to a Grants programme. The purpose of the grants is to foster the growth of Euler protocol by establishing a culture of community-driven development, where individuals making improvements to the Euler Protocol get a say in its future.
