### 1. Your Relationship With Us
1.1 Welcome to [euler.finance](https://www.euler.finance/) and [app.euler.finance](https://app.euler.finance/)
(the “Website”), provided by The Euler Foundation (“Company”, “we”
or “us”). The Company is registered in the Cayman Islands and our
registered office is at 4th Floor, Harbour Place, 103 South Church
Street, P.O. Box 10240, Grand Cayman KY1-1002, George Town, Cayman
Islands.

1.2 This page (the “Terms”) forms an agreement between you and us
and sets forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and
use our protocols, applications and content (including but not
limited to the Website) (collectively, the “Interface”). For
purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of
the Interface.

1.3 **The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and us.** 
Please read them carefully and we recommend that you seek legal
advice on these Terms to understand your use of the Interface. If
you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the
Interface.

### 2. Interface
2.1 The Interface provides functionality for you to interact with
the Euler Protocol (a permissionless non-custodial protocol for the
lending and borrowing of Ethereum-based crypto assets). The
Interface also provides the following non-custodial functions,
including: depositing, withdrawal, minting, burning, transferring,
swapping, and shorting of crypto assets.

2.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the Company does not control or
operate the Euler Protocol and that protocol is managed, controlled
and operated by the holders of the protocol-native governance tokens
called the Euler Governance Token (“EUL”). For further information
on the Euler Protocol, please visit: [docs.euler.finance](https://docs.euler.finance/). 
Such information is provided for informational purposes only and
we do not make any representation or warranty in any form whatsoever
in relation to such information.

2.3 Holders of EUL are not granted any legally enforceable rights or
entitlements. Rather, the Euler Protocol may enable them to make
certain proposals with respect to the Euler Protocol for all EUL
holders to perform several functions.

### 3. Fees
3.1 Neither the Company, nor any of its parents, subsidiaries, and
affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and advisors, charges or receives any form of fee
from any user of the Euler Protocol for operating, maintaining or
developing the Interface.

indicate use of the Interface from prohibited jurisdictions or by
sanctioned persons or other Prohibited Uses. Except as required by
applicable law, there will be no obligation of confidentiality with
respect to any information collected.
